I'm on call this week: I'd be responsible for resolving all the issue in the workflows that my team owns 24/7. I got paged from sleep for my first high severity ticket at midnight last night. 

As a standard procedure, I panicked first: I barely know how the problematic system does and how to handle it. 

Everyone in Canada was off line so I turned to a more senior SDE in India whom I have never talked with before. He took a look and quickly found the root cause. We lower the ticket severity and I went back to sleep.


Technically I did not contribute anything in finding the cause of the problem. 90% it all thanks to my teammate.

But for my 10% contribution I think I have been intentionally build up this mindset:

**It's okay to ask for help.**

From a psychology perspective, we love to help people out. Giving helps to build connection. You ask someone for help because you trust them so asking for help is also giving confirmation. 

I don't care if others think I ask dumb questions: it's more important to me that I get what I need. No one cares about you more than you care about yourself. 

Getting processed information from others is faster than learning from the raw source.There is still a lot of value of doing your own research and comprehending a problem from the basics, but for many problems especially if it's time sensitive, we want to avoid putting hours into duplicate tasks.
