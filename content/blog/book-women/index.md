*Woman* is a very enlightening and thorough walkthrough of what it physically and socially/culturally means to be a woman. 

## Takeaways and reflections

### Female identity

I was raised in a very gender-neutral way. It was not because of some progressive parenting technique in northeast China in the 2000s, but because my dad really wanted a son and my mom thought short hair was easier to take care of. This resulted in me talking and behaving like a regular dude and dressing like a gay guy. My parents did not have any problem with me dressing and acting like a dude — not because they accepted who I was but because of ignorance, after all, that was a time when being gay was less cool so no one was.

My mom was a working mom and she was never good at meeting the traditional expectation for women to “take care of the family”. She did take good care of me — one of the good things about being the only child is that you get the first priority — but I think she’s more proud of her career than of her family. So I got zero of the social bs on how the ultimate goal for any woman was to be a good wife and a good mom. (I’m not saying those values are wrong but I think women should have the right to choose instead of having all these pressured on us.) Instead, I got you cannot trust men and you have to be like men mentally and financially to protect yourself. 

With all those backgrounds, I never felt a strong identification as a woman; on the contrary, sometimes I strongly wish I had a dick because pee standing sounds awesome. I still identify as female and use the pronoun she/her but I don’t wear girly clothes and have been trying to show people I can be just like a man (then my dad would finally be proud of his “son”*). 

Reading this book got me thinking about what it means to me to be a woman for the first time. A lot of things I have been taking for granted or even considered annoying are more than what they look like. My eggs, my womb, my blood, all the things I have had forever but never tried to get to know and never appreciated how each piece of my body works together to make me myself, to make me a woman. 

This book definitely made me take more pride in being a woman. I have focused too much on how things are unfair to women: less strength, menstrual cycle and discrimination in many industries etc. But I never try to see the positive side: a single X chromosome contains more genes than a Y chromosome so girls biologically have more options, lack of testosterone receptors makes someone with XY chromosomes grow into a woman so we’re the default gender, even menopause can be because older women need to help to take care of their grandkids so that our species could have a higher survival rate and then went on and took the world. 

I still don’t wear baby pink or cute little dresses but now I feel more connected to my body and my identity. Being a woman is not something I just have to deal with, but something I can draw strength from. 

### Motherhood and family

Right before I read about the chapter on mother-infant bonding, Erik and I talked about why I didn’t want kids. Erik and I are breaking up soon because of life so we can talk about this freely and objectively knowing having different opinions on family does not matter.

The problem is not really about having children, but about being a mother: taking the physical damage on my body and the long-term responsibility to raise a human being. I used to joke about how I can be a good father but not a mom — I can once in a while take the kid to throw some balls in the park but not all the cooking and cleaning and be there when the baby’s sick. 

I always see the maternal side of womanhood as a negative thing. I don’t get it when people say raising kids is tiring but super rewarding. I don’t understand why it comes so naturally to most people that they want a family. I don’t see why so many women are willing to damage their bodies, sometimes again and again, to just make their life messier. It’s true that if you teach the kids well, then they will take care of you when you’re old, but I’m just not old enough to understand the pain of being old and childless. 

It makes sense for me to have kids because I’m the only child and having kids is the only way for me to truly not be alone in this world. I just don’t emotionally feel the urge and want to have a family. 

This book does not directly talk about motherhood, but as a book specifically talks about women’s body, this is a topic that gets permeated in many chapters. It is a very important aspect of the female identity for most women and the fact that we are the physical carrier of the baby has more or less played a role in evolution to bring us to where we are today. Being a mom is a big part of most women’s life and maybe I should get out of my narrative of I can’t be a mom and be more open to different possibilities. 

## Conclusion

*Woman* is a good blend of scientific facts and perspectives from the author. Womanhood is now something I respect, enjoy and celebrate.

*It’s an Asian joke. I don’t really care about making my parents proud: another only child privilege.
